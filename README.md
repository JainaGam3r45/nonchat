# nonchat
 The best chat plugin for me :3

The plugin supports only Bukkit cores and 1.20.6 version.
That plugin have custom format for chat messages, private chat messages and death messages. Also plugin have auto broadcasting and block banned words.
nonchat also have HEX support, config, you can translate it in messages.yml
9 commands: broadcast, msg, clear, ignore, spy, sc, server, nhelp and nreload.
