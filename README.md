# nonchat
 The best chat plugin for me :3

The plugin supports only Bukkit cores and 1.20.6 version.
That plugin have custom format for chat messages and death messages. Also plugin have auto broadcasting.
nonchat also have HEX support, config and 4 commands: broadcast, msg, clear, server, help and nreload.
